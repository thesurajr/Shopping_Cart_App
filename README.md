🛒 Shopping Cart Application (React + Vite)

📌 About the Project

This is a Shopping Cart web application developed using React.js and Vite.
The project demonstrates how a real-world e-commerce cart works by allowing users to add products to a cart, update quantities, remove items, and view the total price dynamically.

The main goal of this project is to practice React fundamentals, including component-based architecture, state management, props, and handling user interactions.
